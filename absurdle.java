//TA: Chaafen Raees and Afifah Kashif
//The Absurdle class prompts the user with the fun and challenging word guessing game
//known as "Absurdle". First the user has to pick one of the dictionaries given in the files.
//These dictionaries include 'dictionary1.txt','small_dict.txt', and 'dictionary2.txt'.
//After the user picks a dictionary, they have the pick a word size. The user will then 
//have to make a guesses that prunes the entire dictionary that they chose. The user will have
//unlimited tries, but the less tries that they prune the entire dictionary the better.
//Absurdle's goal is to prolong the game for as long as it can. The game ends when the user 
//prunes the entire dictionary.
